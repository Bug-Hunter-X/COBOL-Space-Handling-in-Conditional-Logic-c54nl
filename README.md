# COBOL Space Handling in Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL related to space handling in conditional logic.  The `bug.cob` file showcases the faulty logic and the `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The bug stems from insufficient handling of blank or space-filled alphanumeric fields.  When comparing such fields to literals, it's crucial to account for potential spaces that might affect conditional evaluations. Failure to do so can produce unexpected results and program failures. This is a subtle but common mistake often leading to hard to debug issues.

## Solution

The solution involves explicit space checks and/or using the `COMP` data type, especially when dealing with numeric or conditional logic.
